                            <b>Your first medical orientation</b>
							<p>Your first meeting with our doctors will be at the Pre-Diagnostic clinic. Our doctors will provide you an overview of the Healing Sanctuary Spa treatments and Integrated Medical Clinic services that you can experience during your retreat.</p>
							<b>A closer look at your health</b>
							<p>Your first health screening at the Pre- Diagnostic clinic marks the official start of your wellness journey at The Farm. Our doctors will examine your vital signs, blood, body fat and muscle percentages. Upon request, you can have the doctor assess your heart health and the inner workings of your body through the use of clinical techniques and devices. The results of these tests will be used to augment and re-align the treatments during your retreat.</p>
